This project has the following abilities:
1. Service Discovery using UDP:
A UDP Server opens a port on which it constantly listens for new Client connections. 
It specifically waits for a message "CCS DISCOVER" and if such message was received successfully, then
the server will respond with "CCS FOUND" to a Client.
2.Communication with Clients using TCP:
A TCP Server opens a port on which it constantly listens for new Client connections.
